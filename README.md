## Problems and Solutions

### 1. Sum of Natural Numbers up to N
**Objective:** Calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to N using the formula `Sum = n × (n + 1) / 2`.

### 2. Check if a Number is Prime
**Objective:** Determine if a number is a prime by checking divisibility from 2 to √n.

### 3. Multiplication Table
**Objective:** Print the multiplication table for a number n (from `n × 1` to `n × 10`).

### 4. Print Odd Numbers up to N
**Objective:** Print all odd numbers between 1 and n.

### 5. Sum of Odd Numbers up to N
**Objective:** Compute the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n.

### 6. Count Digits in a Number
**Objective:** Count the total number of digits in a given number.

### 7. Reverse a Number
**Objective:** Reverse the digits of a number using modular arithmetic.

### 8. Find the Largest Digit in a Number
**Objective:** Identify the largest digit in a number.

### 9. Check if a Number is a Palindrome
**Objective:** Verify if a number reads the same forward and backward.

### 10. Sum of Digits of a Number
**Objective:** Compute the sum of all digits in a given number.

Demonstrates function overloading by calculating the areas of a circle, rectangle, and triangle.

### 12. Encapsulation with Employee Details
Implements encapsulation with a class `Employee` to manage employee details securely.

### 13. Inheritance with Student and Result Classes
Demonstrates inheritance with a `Student` base class and a `Result` derived class.

### 14. Polymorphism with Shape Area Calculation
Explores polymorphism to calculate the area of shapes: Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle.

## How to Run the Programs

1. Compile each C++ program using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ program_name.cpp -o output
